# waste-managements
Author - Pravas D S

"Hello Everyone,

I have an innovative idea to help reduce pollution in our surroundings! 🌍✨

I developed an app using Dart and the Flutter framework, designed as a government-mandated platform for every household.

📲 How it Works:

When municipal workers collect waste, they will measure the amount, and residents must upload the data into the app.
At the end of the year, families that generate the least waste will be rewarded as an incentive for maintaining a cleaner environment. 🏆🌱
Additionally, users can book municipal workers through the app to clean their surroundings, ensuring a healthier community.
This initiative encourages responsible waste management and helps create a greener future for all! 🍃♻️
